We are currently not involved in generating degrees, but our course will include partners that allow you to transfer your credits to accepting schools (since our material is harvestime material).

The material teaches a literal bible, without symbolism (for example, the book of Acts miracles are taught as literally occurring).  The version taught is from the KJV bible, with both the Old Testament and New Testament included.

For example, if you are getting started, you will want to start with module 1, and for example pick 3 courses:  Foundations of Faith, Bible Study Methods, and Old Testament survey for example.  These will be your three current classes.  You can take all 4 if you want. ";

You can think of this as your class school book, in PDF format.  You will progress through this at your own pace as if attending a college course.  You will be responsible for writing your own writing assignments (given in the course) and keeping those on your PC.  ";

We will allow you to use this interface as many times as necessary.  This interface supports Exam Testing Mode and Exam Review mode.  In review mode you will see all of the questions answers so you can go back and learn those subjects better in the course material and or online. ";
