#Note: If you have less then 3gb of ram, please see our instructions "BuildBiblePay.txt" and we recommend that you set up Swap Space first, otherwise your system will page with low ram.


#Building for Ubuntu 20, 18, and 17 on Linux:


Step 1:  Install the Ubuntu dependencies:

apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libssl-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils
apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev
apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
apt-get install git
apt-get install curl build-essential libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config python3 bsdmainutils cmake

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev


Step 2: Find a place on your hard drive that will be YOUR APPLICATION ROOT DIR (also known as the root of your github repository).

It is highly recommended that you make it "~/biblepay-develop", so that you can refer to this document (and so that the develop branch stays separate from the master branch.
NOTE: Your blocks and wallet will be stored in "~/.biblepay".  This location is called your "DATA DIRECTORY".  Where is my wallet.dat?  It will be here:  "~/.biblepay/wallet.dat".  And note that your testnet wallet will be here:  ~/.biblepay/testnet3/wallet.dat.   Where are the blocks?  "~/.biblepay/blocks".


STEP 3:  Create the root Application Directory for Biblepay develop:
cd ~
mkdir ~/biblepay-develop
cd biblepay-develop

STEP 4: GIT CLONE: (This sets up the github repository in this location):
git clone --branch develop https://github.com/biblepay/biblepay
 
# OPTIONAL NOTE! If you already have git cloned the master branch by accident without using the --branch develop argument above, cd to your repository root and type "git pull origin develop" next.  
# (YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS IF YOU GIT CLONE --BRANCH develop as mentioned above!)

STEP 5: Compile RANDOMX:

cd ~/biblepay-develop/biblepay/src/crypto/RandomX
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DARCH=native ..
make
# end of RandomX Part

STEP 6: SET UP THE MACHINE PREFIX: (In this case we are using 64 bit ubuntu):  (We also have one for mac and one for windows).

prefix=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
cd ~/biblepay-develop/biblepay/depends
make -j 4 # Choose a good -j value, depending on the number of CPU cores available
cd ..
./autogen.sh

#Note: if echo `pwd` does not return your current working directory, replace it with your working directory such as ~/biblepay-develop/biblepay

./configure --prefix `pwd`/depends/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

make -j 4

#If you have trouble compiling, see more here:
https://github.com/biblepay/biblepay/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md

***************** WHERE ARE THE COMPILED FILES? *********************************
To run QT, do this:
cd ~/biblepay-develop/biblepay/src/qt
./biblepay-qt -testnet=1

To run the biblepay daemon go here:
cd ~/biblepay-develop/biblepay/src
./biblepayd -testnet=1

To run the biblepay command line client go here:
cd ~/biblepay-develop/biblepay/src
./biblepay-cli getinfo


### Good luck, and God Bless you! ###



*************************************************** OPTIONAL - UPGRADING ONLY *********************************************************************************
How do I upgrade Biblepay after the devs push a leisure Upgrade notification on the forum?     
#NOTE: DO NOT DO THIS IF YOU ARE BUILDING THE FIRST TIME, THIS IS ONLY NECESSARY AFTER WE NOTIFY EVERYONE FOR AN UPGRADE:
cd ~/biblepay-develop
git pull origin develop
cd src
make -j 4



*** NOTE:   Watchman-on-the-wall is no longer required in BiblePay (as it is compiled as a part of our wallet now) **** (Hurray, that would have been more work!)
